# Reproducible analytical pipelines with rix and Nix -- a little Demo

Just a little demo that shows how to run a reproducible analytical
pipeline written in R (that uses the amazing {targets} package)
on Github Actions. The required environment gets built using Nix.
The default.nix file contains the Nix expressions that defines
the environment. It gets generated by the script create_envv.R, and
then the environment gets built by Nix in the Github Actions.

Outputs of the runs can be found in the target-runs branch of this
repository.
